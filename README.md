SPYDR Social will allow peer-to-peer payment transactions between friends, and opportunity to earn native SPYDR tokens for increased user activity on your page. These tokens users earn can be viewed as a stake in the platform, creating an incentive for use for it to perform well.

As the user earns tokens, they can accrue in value like an investment, which is better then earning fractional USD that just sits in your account as you work to make more.

You can sell the tokens for Ethereum by interacting with the SPYDR DEX that is being built into the platform. I am working on making the DEX more user friendly for people unfamiliar with cryptocurrency.
